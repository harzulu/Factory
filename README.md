# üíæ Installation Requirements

## For Both Ô£ø Mac & Windows systems

* Once you have Git installed on your computer, go to <a href="https://github.com/harzulu/Factory.Solution">this GitHub repository</a>, click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the page, and clone this application with the following command:
<br> `git clone https://github.com/harzulu/Factory.Solution`.

## üìÅ Installing C#, .NET, dotnet script, & MySQL

### **This program requires C# and the .NET Framework to be installed on your machine:**

## For Mac Ô£ø
 * Download <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer">this</a> .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit). Clicking this link will prompt a .pkg file download from Microsoft.
* Open the .pkg file. This will launch an installer which will walk you through installation steps. Use the default settings the installer suggests.
* Confirm the installation is successful by opening your terminal and running the command `$ dotnet --version`, which should return something like: `2.2.105`. 

## For Windows (10+)

* Download <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer">this</a> 64-bit .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit). Clicking these links will prompt a .exe file download from Microsoft.
* Open the file and follow the steps provided by the installer for your OS.
* Confirm the installation is successful by opening a new Windows PowerShell window and running the command `dotnet --version`. You should see something a response like this: `2.2.105`.

## For Mac & Windows Operating Systems

* Install dotnet script with the following terminal command:
<br> `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`.

# üñ•Ô∏è Opening the Project on your Local System

* Once the project has been cloned to your computer and you have all the necessary items on your local computer, open the project in the application of your choice (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Code Studio</a> was used and is recommended by the application builder)

### AppSettings.json File

You will need to create an `appsettings.json` file in the `Factory` folder. <br>
Once you have the file made, put in this code: <br>
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=hotelcrm;uid=root;pwd=PASSWORD;"
  }
}
```
**Make sure to have a MySQL server up and running on your machine on port 3306** <br>
**Replace `PASSWORD` with the password to your server created for this project**

### MySQL Database Setup

* First, using your terminal or command line, navgate to the HotelCRM folder in HotelCRM.Solution: `/Factory.Soulution/Factory`.
* Next, run the command: `dotnet ef database update`.
* You should have your database created for this project.

### Opening The Project
* Finally, run the command `dotnet build` to get bin/ and obj/ folders downloaded, then `dotnet run` to run the application. The program should be connected to a localhost port, most likely 5000. Your terminal or command line should specify which port it is on.
* Type into your web browser `http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]/` to view the project.
